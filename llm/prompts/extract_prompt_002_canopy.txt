You are given:
1. A scanned image of Form C - Plot characteristics (canopy openness & soil).
2. The form layout showing multiple plots, each with several subplot rows.

Your task:
Extract only the canopy openness readings (north, east, west, south) recorded once per plot.

Rules:
- Each plot has 5 subplot rows (subplotID = 0-4).
- Canopy readings are taken only once per plot, at the plot centre (subplotID=0).
- Identify these canopy readings and ignore any pencilled or marginal numbers in other subplot rows.
- For each plot, output one JSON object containing:
  blockID, transectID, plotID, subplotID=0, areaName, date,
  canopy_north, canopy_east, canopy_west, canopy_south.
- If a canopy cell is blank, record "NA".

Output:
- Respond only with a JSON array of objects, one per plot (i.e. one per canopy measurement).
