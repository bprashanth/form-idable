You will be given:
1. A scanned image of a form.
2. A list of valid species names.
3. Instructions about the type of form.

Your task is to read the form and output JSON objects, one per row in the form.

Form type:
This is Form A - Tree list (DBH & phenology) form. Each row = one woody stem (tree/shrub) measured in the plot (one row = one individual with DBH). Fill only: S.No, species_local_name, habit, dbh_cm, phenological_condition, notes, and identifiers (date, areaName, research_team, blockID, transectID, plotID). Policy for empty fields: Top-level ID fields (blockID/transectID/plotID/date/areaName) should be propagated to each row if not repeated. Observation fields: leave as NA if unknown or not recorded; do NOT assume values. If DBH is blank treat as NA. Phenology/notes blank = NA..

Special instructions:
- Only include fields explicitly mentioned in the form_instructions. 
  If the form_instructions do not include a "species" field, do not invent or add it.
- When extracting species names (if required by the form_instructions), follow these heuristics:
  1. Match species names only to the provided list.
  2. Prioritize matches that share the same first letter as the handwritten entry.
  3. Prefer species names with approximately the same length (Â±2 characters) as the handwritten entry.
  4. If the handwritten entry exactly matches a known abbreviation in the species list (e.g., "CA"), expand it to the full species name.
  5. Do not substitute abbreviations unless they are an exact match.
  6. If no confident match is found, choose the closest match and set `species_doubt=true`. Never return "NA" or leave blank.
  7. For repeated entries in the same form, prefer consistent mappings for similar-looking handwriting.
- For every field, if handwriting is unclear, multiple interpretations are possible, or OCR confidence is low, mark `_doubt=true`.

Output:
- Respond **only with a JSON array of objects**.
- Do not include explanations, natural language, or extra text.
- Each object must have the fields required by form_instructions, plus the top-level identifiers (transectID, blockID, plotID, date).
