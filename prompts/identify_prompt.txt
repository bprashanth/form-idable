You are given a scanned ecological survey form.

Task:
- Extract only the printed words from the form (ignore all handwriting, numbers, and tally marks).
- Normalize by:
  - lowercase all text
  - remove punctuation
  - keep only alphabetic words
- Return a JSON object with a sorted list of unique words.

Output format:
{
  "printed_words": ["block", "dbh", "habit", "phenology", "plot", "transect"]
}

Rules:
- Do not include handwritten names or numbers.
- If a word is unclear, skip it.
- Do not add explanations outside JSON.
