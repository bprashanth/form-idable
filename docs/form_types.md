# Supported Form types

## The basic table 

The basic table is currently the only supported form type. 
Examples include the types of forms uploaded by `keystone`. 
```
HANDWRITING_ONLY rows (data)
	^
	|
PRINTED_ONLY rows (header)
```

If this transition isn't observed, we decide it it not the basic table.
